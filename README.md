TODO:
- [ ] listbox skip attribute does not feel great as an api
- [ ] m-option maybe should emit clicked event?
- [ ] m-input submit using enter
- [ ] m-input: Error text not populating in test - possible timing issue with m-invalid event listener registration vs validation
- [ ] m-input: Implement internals.ariaInvalid setting for accessibility (currently null)
- [ ] Listbox label and error state like input
