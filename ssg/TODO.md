# Asset Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem
Asset URLs in generated HTML contained double slashes (`//`) at the beginning (e.g., `//assets/file.jpg` or `//subpage/file.jpg`), causing invalid links and file access errors. This occurred when rendering sub-page content using `$image.asset()` or `$site.asset().link()` in Zine.

- Affected both page assets (in subdirectories) and site assets (in `assets/`).
- Errors like "error accessing file '//path/to/asset.jpg': FileNotFound" during build.
- Root cause: Incorrect URL prefix generation in Zine's asset linking logic, adding an extra `/` for root-hosted sites.

## Resolution
1. **Updated Zine Source Code** (in `/tmp/zine`):
   - `src/context/Asset.zig`: Changed page asset URL generation to use `html.printAssetUrlPrefix()` instead of `ctx.printLinkPrefix()` to ensure consistent prefix handling.
   - `src/render/html.zig`: Modified `printAssetUrlPrefix()` to omit the leading `/` for root sites (changed `else` clause from `try w.writeAll("/");` to no output).
   - `src/context/Page.zig`: Trimmed leading `/` from page paths in the asset function to prevent double slashes.

2. **Updated Site Content**:
   - Changed `$image.asset("example-image-3.jpg")` to `$image.siteAsset("example-image-3.jpg")` in `content/design-system/index.smd` and `content/design-system/foundation-colors.smd`.
   - Moved `example-image-3.jpg` to `assets/` for site-wide access.
   - Updated `layouts/index.shtml` to use `$site.asset("example-image-3.jpg").link()`.

3. **Verification**:
   - Rebuild Zine with the source changes.
   - Build and serve the site; asset URLs should now be correct (e.g., `/assets/example-image-3.jpg`).
   - No more double `//` or file access errors.

## Notes
- The issue was specific to root-hosted sites (e.g., `https://example.com/` without subpaths).
- Workaround: Use `$site.asset()` and place assets in `assets/` to avoid page-specific path issues.
- Reported to Zine project for upstream fix.
