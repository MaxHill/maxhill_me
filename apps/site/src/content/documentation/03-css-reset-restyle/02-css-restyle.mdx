## Typesetting
The `.typesetting` class creates consistent vertical rhythm for text-heavy content using CSS Grid.

## Use Cases

Apply `.typesetting` to containers with:

- Articles and blog posts
- Documentation pages
- Long-form written content
- Any content requiring consistent vertical rhythm

<m-card>
    <strong slot="title">Without .typesetting</strong>
    <div>
      # Article Title
      ## Introduction
      This is a paragraph without the typesetting class. Notice how the spacing feels inconsistent and elements appear cramped together.
      ## Main Content
      Another paragraph here to show the spacing issues when not using the typesetting utility.
    </div>
</m-card>
