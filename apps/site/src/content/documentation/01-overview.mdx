The design system consists of design tokens expressed as css custom properties. The design tokens are then organized into two main layers, foundation and semantic.



---
## Foundation tokens
Foundation tokens are the smallest building blocks. They are primitive values and their describe what they are. For example `—radius-1` is the a value that should be used to specify, well how rounded the corners of an element should be.

They serve an important purpose, they constrain the possible values from anything to a subset of pre-defined ones. This both speeds up the decision process and improves consistency through the ui.


The foundational tokens in this design system are an adaptation of the fantastic [open props](https://open-props.style/)

## Semantic tokens

The semantic tokens is an abstraction on top of the foundation tokens that 
should encode a pattern that should be applied across multiple elements 
like `—color-text`.

### Themes
A good rule of thumb is that themes should only change semantic layer tokens.
This also gives a good indication on whether a token is foundational or semantic.

By default there are two themes setup; light and dark. These mainly changes 
the colors from light to dark. But there could be more themes that changes 
other custom properties in the semantic layer like input radius or spacing. 
These could even complement each other. For example having theme “light” and 
“spacious” applied at the same time (if a “spacious” theme was created).

For more info about the color setup in the themes see the [Color system](#color-system)
