Let's take a look at all the pieces we have. From the smallest building blocks (foundational design tokens) to the biggest (webcomponent) and everything in between (semantic tokens & css framework)

---

The design system has two main parts.
The css framework and the components.
The css framework consists of the following parts:
- design tokens
    - Foundation layer
    - Semantic layer
- css reset
- base styles
- css-components
- layouts - Bigger
- utils - Utility classes that can be used as building blocks

All the css framework parts are in different layers and documentation for them can be found on this page.
Layers follow the same order as above.

`@layer reset, foundations, semantics, base, components, layouts, utils;`

The component system is a collection of webcomponents
There is some overlap between the two. For example there is a css-component called card as well as a webcomponent called card.
