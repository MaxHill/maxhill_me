import SwatchVizualizer from "./SwatchVisualizer.astro";

As mentioned the semantic layer deals quite a bit with colors.

To make it easier to use accessible colors there is a color system in place that helps with generating pallets. 

From 4 seed colors: neutral, primary, destructive and constructive 4 swatches are generated with the same names.

<SwatchVizualizer name="primary" />
<SwatchVizualizer name="neutral" />
<SwatchVizualizer name="destructive" />
<SwatchVizualizer name="constructive" />

### How it works
The system starts with four seed colors that define the base hue for each color family:

#### 1. Seed colors
- `--color-primary-seed` - Main brand color
- `--color-neutral-seed` - Grayscale colors
- `--color-constructive-seed` - Success/positive actions
- `--color-destructive-seed` - Error/negative actions

#### 2. Color scale generation
Each seed color is automatically expanded into an 11-step scale (50-950) using `color-mix()` in oklab color space:

- **50-400**: Progressively lighter tints (mixed with white)
- **500**: The seed color itself
- **600-950**: Progressively darker shades (mixed with black)

#### 3. Swatch mapping
The scale values are then mapped to semantic tokens that describe their purpose. These mappings flip between light and dark themes to maintain proper contrast.
