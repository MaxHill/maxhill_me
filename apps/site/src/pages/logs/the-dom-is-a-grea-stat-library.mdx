title: The dom is a great state library
draft: true
---


I've worked with a lot of frontend solutions and when building a frontend i like 
to split the data into two: ui-state and data. Ui-state depends on data and not 
the other way  arround.

I've recently started to explore webcomponents a lot more. I came into this with 
a lot of previous experience working with frontend frameworks like, react, 
svelte, angular and even some vue. You name it, I've probably tried it.

What all of these have in common is that they try to separate ui-state from the 
dom. This is a huge difference between what feels natural (at least for me) when
writing webcomponents. Webcomponents begs for their state to be encoded in the dom.

I've had the notion in my head that i don't like this and the only sane way to 
do frontend development is to have this separation. However... I think I think 
it's great... the DOM might be one of the better ui-state management libraries.
Just set attributes and query for them.

There's a 1000 and 1 different state management libraries and the DOM is 
one of them.
