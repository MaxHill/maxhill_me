# Visual Elements

Visual elements add depth and interest to the interface while maintaining a cohesive design language.

## Spacing

Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and hierarchy. Our spacing scale uses a base unit of 0.25rem.

## Borders

Borders define boundaries and create separation between elements. Use semantic border colors that adapt to the theme.

## Shadows

Subtle shadows provide depth and elevation. Use sparingly to emphasize important elements.

## Effects

Special effects like glitch animations can add personality to key interface moments.
